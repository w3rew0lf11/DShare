"hello","Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Ready to explore decentralized file sharing?",""
"what is DShare?","DShare is a blockchain-based decentralized file sharing system using Ethereum smart contracts and IPFS storage, featuring temporary encrypted chats and user moderation tools.","https://biopassportofficial.medium.com/your-ultimate-guide-to-the-rise-of-decentralized-file-sharing-networks-3cc1a2cffedd"
"how does DShare differ from Google Drive?","Unlike centralized services, DShare eliminates single points of failure through IPFS distributed storage and ensures file integrity via blockchain verification.","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370872172_Decentralized_File_Sharing_using_Blockchain_Empowering_Peer-to-Peer_Collaboration_The_Rise_of_Decentralized_File_Sharing"
"what technologies power DShare?","Core stack: React frontend, Node.js/Express backend, MongoDB for metadata, IPFS for file storage, Ethereum blockchain with Solidity smart contracts, and VirusTotal API.",""
"how does file encryption work?","Files are encrypted before IPFS storage using AES-256, with content hashes (SHA-256) recorded on Ethereum blockchain for tamper-proof verification.",""
"what is the file size limit?","Maximum 100MB per file due to IPFS block constraints and Ethereum gas optimization. Larger file support is under development.",""
"how long do chat messages persist?","Temporary chats auto-delete after 24 hours. Only reported conversations are archived for moderation purposes.",""
"how do I report abusive users?","Click the report button in chat/file sharing interfaces. Reports trigger admin review and potential account suspension via smart contracts.",""
"what happens if an IPFS node fails?","Files are replicated across minimum 3 nodes. DShare automatically repins content to new nodes if failures occur.",""
"how does VirusTotal integration work?","All files undergo VirusTotal scanning before IPFS upload. Infected files are rejected immediately.",""
"can I share files privately?","Yes! Set permissions during upload: Public (anyone), Private (your wallet only), or Shared (specific wallet addresses).",""
"how are smart contracts used?","Contracts manage: 1) File metadata storage 2) Access permissions 3) User reporting 4) CID-based integrity verification.","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.01728"
"what is a Content Identifier (CID)?","Unique IPFS-generated hash acting as digital fingerprint for files, ensuring authenticity and preventing duplication.",""
